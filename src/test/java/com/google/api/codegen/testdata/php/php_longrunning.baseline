      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * Service Description: Manages long-running operations with an API service.
 *
 * When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed
 * to return [Operation][google.longrunning.Operation] to the client, and the client can use this
 * interface to receive the real response asynchronously by polling the
 * operation resource, or pass the operation resource to another API (such as
 * Google Cloud Pub/Sub API) to receive the response.  Any API service that
 * returns long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interface
 * so developers can have a consistent client experience.
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL: This client library class has not yet been declared GA (1.0). This means that
 * even though we intend the surface to be stable, we may make backwards incompatible changes
 * if necessary.
 *
 * This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * ```
 * $options = [
 *     'serviceAddress' => 'my-service-address',
 *     'scopes' => ['my-service-scope'],
 * ];
 * $operationsClient = new OperationsClient($options);
 * try {
 *     $name = '';
 *     $response = $operationsClient->getOperation($name);
 * } finally {
 *     if (isset($operationsClient)) {
 *         $operationsClient->close();
 *     }

     *     @type mixed $port The port on which to connect to the remote host. Default 443.
     *     @type Channel $channel
     *           A `Channel` object. If not specified, a channel will be constructed.
     *           NOTE: This option is only valid when utilizing the gRPC transport.
     *     @type ChannelCredentials $sslCreds
     *           A `ChannelCredentials` object for use with an SSL-enabled channel.
     *           Default: a credentials object returned from

     *           If true, this forces gRPC to create a new channel instead of using a persistent channel.

     *     @type string $clientConfigPath
     *           Path to a JSON file containing client method configuration, including retry settings.
     *           Specify this setting to specify the retry behavior of all methods on the client.

     *           An associative array in which the keys are method names (e.g. 'createFoo'), and
     *           the values are retry settings to use for that method. The retry settings for each
     *           method can be a {@see Google\ApiCore\RetrySettings} object, or an associative array
     *           of retry settings parameters. See the documentation on {@see Google\ApiCore\RetrySettings}
     *           for example usage. Passing a value of null is equivalent to a value of
     *           ['retriesEnabled' => false]. Retry settings provided in this setting override the
     *           settings in $clientConfigPath.
     *     @type callable $authHttpHandler A handler used to deliver PSR-7 requests specifically
     *           for authentication. Should match a signature of

     *     @type string|TransportInterface $transport The transport used for executing network
     *           requests. May be either the string `rest` or `grpc`. Additionally, it is possible
